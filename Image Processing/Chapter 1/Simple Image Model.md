- An image is denoted by a 2-D function in the form of $(x, y)$. The value or amplitude of $f$ at co-ordinates $(x, y)$ is a positive scalar quantity whose physical meaning is determined by the source of the image
- When an image is generated by a physical process, its values are proportional to energy radiated by physical source
- $f(x, y)$ must be a non-zero finite value
- $f(x, y)$ is characterised by two components:
	1. The amount of source illumination incident on the scene, $i(x, y)$
	2. The amount of source illumination reflected back by the scene or the object in the scene, $fr(x, y)$
- The functions combine as a product to form $f(x, y)$
- The intensity of a monochrome image, at any point $(x, y)$ is called the graylevel $(L)$ of the image. For a monochrome image, $$L=f(X_1)$$    where, $L$ lies between $L^{max}$ and $L^{min}$. The interval $[L^{min}, L^{max}]$ is called grayscale, where, $L=0$ is considered black and $L=1$ is considered white. All intermediate values are considered *shades of grey*
	$$\displaylines{L_{min} \leftarrow i_{min}, r_{min} \\ L_{max} \leftarrow i_{max}, r_{max}}$$

### Definition of Image:
- A 2-D function that measures characteristics such as brightness or colour
- Projection of 3-D scene into a 2-D plane
- Composition of finite no. of elements with particular location and value. These elements are called picture elements, image elements, pels, pixels.
- **Mathematically**, Image is defined as a 2-D function, $f(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are plane co-ordinates and the amplitude of $f$ for any value $(x, y)$ is called the intensity of image at that point.
- To refer to the intensity of a Monochrome image, we use the term *Gray scale* or *Gray level*

### Application of Digital Image Processing (D.I.P):
- Remote Sensing via Satellites and other Spacecrafts
- Image Transmission and Storage for business application
- Medical Processing (E.C.G, X-Ray, M.R.I, Ultra-Sound, N.M.R)
- Radio Detection and Ranging (RADAR)
- Sound Navigation and Ranging (SONAR)
- Acoustics Image Processing
- Robotics and Automated Inspection of Industrial Parts
- Earth Resources, Agricultural Crops, Weather Monitoring, Flood and Fire Control

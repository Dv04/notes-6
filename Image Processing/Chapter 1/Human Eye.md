### Cones
- They are located in the fovea and are sensitive to colour. Each one is connected to its own nerve end
- Cone vision is called *photo-pic* (or *bright-light* vision or *day* vision)
- There are 3 types of cones: Red, Green and Blue
- **Rods**: Rods are giving a general, overall picture of the field of view
- They see only brightness (not colour) and are not involved in colour vision
- Several rods are connected to a single nerve and are sensitive to low-level of illumination (also called as *night-vision*)

### Mesopic Vision
- Intermediate region of illumination between dim and bright light
- Both rods and cones are active

### Fovea
- It is circular (1.5 mm in diameter) but can be assumed to be a square sensor array
- The density of cones: $150,000 elements/mm^2 ~ 337,000$ for fovea

### Blind Spot
- The region of emergence of optic nerve from eye
- Place on retina where optic nerve connects, and which consists of no lights sensors

### Luminance or Intensity
- Emitting or Reflecting light from Object
- Luminance of an object is independent of luminance of surrounding objects

### Brightness
- It is the perceived luminance. Depends on luminance of surround
- Two objects with different surroundings could have identical luminance but different brightness

### Contrast
- It is determined by the difference in the colour and brightness of the light reflected or emitted by an object and other objects within the same field of view

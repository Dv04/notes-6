- An image may be continuous with respect to the $(x, y)$ co-ordinates and also in amplitude. To convert it into digital from, we have to sample the function in both co-ordinates and amplitudes
- Digitalising the co-ordinate values, is called **Sampling**
- Digitalising the amplitude values, is called **Quantisation**

### Binary Image:
- It can take 2 values (0 and 1) or typically black and white. 
- Binary images takes only 1 binary digit to represent each pixel, so it is also known as *1-bit image*

### Grayscale Image:
- These images are also known as 'monochrome' or 'one-colour image'. They only contain graylevel information, they do not contain any colour information

### Colour Image:
- They are created as 3-band monochrome image data
- Four types of colour model:
	1. R.G.B (Red-Green-Blue): Primary Colours

	3. H.S.I (Hue-Saturation-Intensity):

### Multispectral Image
- It contains the information outside the normal human perceptual range
- Information represented is not directly visible by human system so, these are not images in usual sense
- However, by mapping the different spectral band to R.G.B components, the information is represented in visual form
- *Examples*: X-Ray, IR, Ultraviolet, etc.

### Image Sensor
- With reference to sensing, 2 elements are required to acquire a digital image:
	1. A physical device that is sensitive to the energy radiated by the object
	2. Specialised Image processing hardware

### Software and Mass Storage
- The software consists of specialised modules that perform specific tasks such as arithmetic and logical operations
- An image of size $1024 \times 1024$ pixels in which the intensity of each pixel is 8-bit, requires 1 Mb of storage space, when the image is not compressed
- The storage for image processing application falls into 3 categories:
	1. *Short-term Storage* during processing
	2. *Online Storage* for fast retrieval
	3. *Architectural Storage* such as magnetic tapes and disks

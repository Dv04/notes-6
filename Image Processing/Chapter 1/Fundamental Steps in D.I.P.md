- The methods whose outputs and inputs are both images
- The methods whose outputs are attributes extracted from those images

### Image Acquisition
- It is the action of retrieving an image from some source and digitised using an A2D converter for further processing

### Image Enhancement
- In this step, the acquired image is manipulated to meet the requirement of the specified task. It is subjective in nature
- *Example*: Adjusting the contrast, brightness, etc.

### Image Restoration
- It deals with improving the appearance of image. It is objective in nature
- *Example*: Removing noise or blur from the images

### Colour Image Processing
- It performs the colour modelling or colour correction in 16-bit R.G.B images

### Wavelets and Multi-resolution Processing
- Wavelets are small waves of limited duration used to calculate the time frequency information. They are the building blocks leading to multi-resolution processing

### Image Compression
- For transferring images to other devices or due to computation storage constraints, image needs to be compressed. This process saves bandwidth on the server

### Morphological Processing
- It provides the tools useful in the representation and description of shape need to be extracted for further processing.
- *Example*: Erosion and dilation operations to sharpen and blur the edges of an image separately

### Image Segmentation
- Partitioning an image into different key parts to simplify and change the representation of an image into something that is more easier to analyse

### Representation and Description
- This step is followed after image segmentation. 
- Representation decides whether the segmented region should be depicted as a boundary or the complete region.
- Description differentiates one class of objects from another

### Object Detection and Recognition
- The labelling of images after representation and description phase

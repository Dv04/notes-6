- To apply a block cipher in a variety of applications, five " modes of operation" have been defined
- The five modes are intended to cover a wide variety of applications of encryption for which a block cipher could be used
- These modes are intended for use with any symmetric block cipher, including triple DES and AES:
	1. [[ECB|Electronic Code Book]]
	2. [[CBC|Cipher Block Chaining]]
	3. [[CFB|Cipher Feedback]]
	4. [[OFB|Output Feedback]]
	5. [[CTR|Counter]]

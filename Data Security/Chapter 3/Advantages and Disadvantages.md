### Advantages:
- **Security**: It is considered highly secure and has withstood extensive cryptanalysis over the years
- **Efficiency**: A.E.S is computationally efficient, striking a good balance between speed and security
- **Standardisation**: A.E.S is an international standard widely accepted around the world
- **Versatility**: A.E.S supports different key sizes (128, 192 and 256 bits) providing flexibility to choose level of security required

### Disadvantages:
- **Key Management**: While A.E.S itself is secure, the security of the overall system depends heavily on proper key management.
- **Side-Channel Attack**: A.E.S implementation may be vulnerable to side-channel attacks, where an attacker gains information from the physical

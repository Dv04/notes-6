- **Key Management Practices**: Implement robust key management practices to ensure the secure generation, storage distribution of cryptographic keys. Regularly update and rotate keys to enhance security
- **Countermeasures for Side-Channel Attacks**: Employ Countermeasures against side-channel attacks, such as masking, blinding or using hardware-based security modules. These techniques help protect against information leakage through unintended channels
- **Enhanced Key Derivation Functions (K.D.F)**: Strengthen key derivation functions to make it computationally expensive for attackers to brute force or guess the encryption keys
- **Use of Authenticated Encryption Modes**: Consider using authenticated encryption modes to provide confidentiality and integrity protection
- **Hardware Acceleration**: Implementing A.E.S in hardware can improve performance and resist certain types of attacks. Specialised hardware components can be designed to securely perform A.E.S operations

- Involves replacing each letter of the alphabet with the letter standing three places further down the alphabet
- **Encryption**:
	- $C = E(k, p)\;mod\;26$
- **Decryption**:
	- $P = D(k, c)\;mod\;26$
- **Brute Force Attack on Caesar Cipher**:
	- Encryption and Decryption Algorithms are known
	- Only 25 keys to try
	- Language of plain-text is known and easily recognisable

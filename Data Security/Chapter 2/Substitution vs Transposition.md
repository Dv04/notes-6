| **Changes**       | Letters retain its position, changes its identity                            | Letters retain its identity, changes its position                                 |
| **Disadvantages** | Last letters of alphabet, which are mostly low frequency tend to stay at end | Keys very close to correct key will reveal long sections of legible plain-text    |
| **Example**       | Ceaser Cipher                                                                | Rail Fence Cipher                                                                 |

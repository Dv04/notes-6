- An improvement to Caesar Cipher
- Instead of shifting alphabets by some number, this scheme uses some permutation of letters in alphabet
- Sender and Receiver decide on a randomly selected permutation of letters of alphabet
- **Attacks on Mono-Alphabetic Cipher**:
	- If the nature of plain-text is known, then regularities of a language can be exploited
	- Relative frequency of letters can be determined and compared to a standard frequency

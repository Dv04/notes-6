- A transposition cipher does not substitute one symbol for another, instead it changes the location of symbols
- Simplest such cipher is the *rail fence technique*, in which the plain-text is written down as sequence of diagonals and then read off as sequence of rows

- **Columnar Transposition Technique**: A more complex scheme where the message is written in a rectangle, row by row, and the cipher is then read column by column, where the order of columns is permuted
- The order of columns then becomes the key of the algorithm
- This order of key is then mapped to get another permutation of key that will decrypt the cipher

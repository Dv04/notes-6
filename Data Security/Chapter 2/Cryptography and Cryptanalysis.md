- **Cryptography**: It is the study of design of techniques for ensuring the secrecy and/or authenticity of information
- **Cryptanalysis**: It deals with defeating such techniques to recover information, or forging information that will be accepted as authentic
- Cryptographic Algorithms and protocols can be grouped into four main areas:
	1. **Symmetric Encryption**: Used to secure contents of blocks or streams of data of any size, including messages, files, encryption keys, and passwords
	2. **Asymmetric Encryption**: Used to conceal small blocks of data, such as encryption keys and hash function values, which are used in digital signatures
	3. **Data Integrity Algorithms**: Used to protect blocks of data, such as messages, from alteration
	4. **Authentication Protocols**: Schemes based on use of cryptographic algorithms designed to authenticate the identity of entities

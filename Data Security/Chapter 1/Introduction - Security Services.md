**Data Security**: Science and Study of methods of protecting data from unauthorised disclosure and modification

### **Need of Security**:
- Increasing threat of attacks

## **OSI(Open Systems Interconnection) System Architecture**:
- It focuses on Security Attacks, Mechanisms, and Services.
- **Security Attack**: Any action that compromises security of information owned by an organisation.
- **Security Mechanism**: A process that is designed to detect, prevent, or recover from a security attack.
- **Security Service**: A communication service that enhances the security of the data processing systems and the information transfers of an organisation.

### **Security Attacks**:
- **Passive Attack**: Attempts to learn or make use of information from the system but does not affect system resources. ^2c6c66
	1. [[Release of message contents]]
	2. [[Traffic Analysis]]
- **Active Attack**: Attempts to alter system resources or affect their operation.
	1. [[Masquerade]]
	2. [[Replay]]
	3. [[Modification of Messages]]
	4. [[Denial of Service]]
- [[Difference between Passive and Active Attacks]]


### **[[Security Mechanisms]]**

### **Security Services**:
- X.800 standard defines a security as a service that is provided by a protocol layer of communicating open systems and that ensures security of the systems or of data transfers.
- Security services are divided into 5 different categories:
	1. [[Authentication]]
	2. [[Access Control]]
	3. [[Data Confidentiality]]
	4. [[Data Integrity]]
	5. [[Non-Repudiation]]

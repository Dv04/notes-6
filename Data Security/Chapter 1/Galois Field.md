- Also known as Finite [[Finite Fields - Group, Rings, Fields#^6c7c65|Field]]
- Plays a key role in cryptography
- Can show no. of elements in a finite field must be a power of a prime $p^n$
- Denoted by: $GF(p^n)$
- $GF(p)$ is the set of integers {0, 1, ..., p - 1} with arithmetic operations modulo prime p, these have a finite field, and *have a multiplicative inverse*
- Hence, arithmetic is "well-behaved" and can do addition, multiplication and division without leaving the field $GF(p)$

### **Properties of Galois Field**:
- **Finite Size**:
	- Most important property
	- Has a specific no. of elements, and it is **not possible** to add more elements to it
	- Size represented by a prime number $p$
- **Closure**: It remains closed under both addition and multiplication operations, meaning that result of any operation performed within the set will always be an element of set
- **Commutative**: It is commutative under both addition and multiplication. Hence the order of elements does not matter in performing operations
- **Associative**: It is associative under both addition and multiplication operations. Hence, the grouping of elements in an operation does not matter
- **Distributive**: It is distributive, hence, multiplication distributes over addition
- **Identity Elements**: Has two elements: 0 for addition and 1 for multiplication
- **Inverse Elements**: Every element in Galois Field has an inverse under both addition and multiplication. The inverse for addition is the negative of the original element and for multiplication is the reciprocal of the original element

- It is a resampling technique used in statistics and machine learning to estimate the uncertainty associated with a sample statistic or to assess the variability of a predictive model
- It involves generating multiple datasets, called bootstrap samples, by randomly sampling observations with replacement from original dataset
- These bootstrap samples are used to estimate confidence intervals, assess the stability of model estimates and perform hypothesis testing
- Applications
	1. Assessment of model stability and variability in predictive modelling
	2. Hypothesis testing and construction of statistical tests and confidence intervals
- Advantages:
	1. Does not rely on strict assumptions about underlying distribution of data
	2. Provides a robust and flexible approach to estimate uncertainty and variability
	3. Can be applied to various statistical and machine learning tasks, including estimation, prediction and hypothesis testing

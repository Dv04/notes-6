### Supervised Learning:
- Involves training a model on a labelled dataset
- The model learns a mapping function that predicts the output for new inputs
- Algorithms: Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, SVM, KNN, Decision Trees, etc
- They are further classified into: Regression and Classification
- Examples: Email Spam Detection, House Price Prediction, Stock Price Prediction, etc.

### Unsupervised Learning:
- Involves learning patters and structures from unlabelled data
- There are no explicit labels provided during training
- It is often used for exploratory data analysis, data pre-processing and feature learning
- Algorithms: K-Means Clustering, Hierarchical Clustering, PCA, etc.
- They are used for: Clustering, Dimensionality Reduction and Anomaly Reduction
- Examples: Customer Segmentation, Document Clustering, etc.

- It is a statistical measure that describes the strength and direction of relationship between two variables
- It quantifies the extent to which changes in one variable are associated with changes in another variable
- It is commonly used to assess the degree of linear association between two continuous variables and to identify patters or trends in data
- It calculates a correlation coefficient, which indicates the strength and direction of relationship between variable. It ranges from -1 to +1, where:
	1. +1 => Perfect Positive Correlation, meaning that as one variable increases, the other variable also increases linearly
	2. -1 => Perfect Negative Correlation, meaning that as one variable increases, the other variable decreases linearly
	3. 0 => Indicates no linear correlation between variables
- Most commonly used correlation coefficient is Pearson Coefficient (r), which measures the linear relationship between two continuing variables

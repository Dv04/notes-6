- They leverage patterns and relationships within data to forecast outcomes or estimate probabilities
- Can be built using supervised and unsupervised algorithms
- Process typically involves:
	1. Data Pre-Processing
	2. Feature Engineering
	3. Model Selection
	4. Training
	5. Evaluation
	6. Deployment
- Examples: Forecasting Stock Prices, etc.

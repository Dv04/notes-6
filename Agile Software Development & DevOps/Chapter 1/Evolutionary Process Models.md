- They are iterative type models
- They allow to develop more complete versions of software
- Following are evolutionary process models:
	- Prototyping Model
	- Spiral Model
	- Concurrent Development Model

### Spiral Model
- Software is developed in a series of incremental releases
- During early iterations, additional release may be a paper model or prototype
- During later iterations, more and more complete versions of engineered systems are produced
- It is divided into four parts:
	- Objective Setting
	- Risk Assessment and Reduction
	- Development and Validation
	- Planning
- Advantages:
	- High amount of risk analysis
	- Useful for large and mission-critical projects
- Disadvantages:
	- Can be a costly model to use
	- Doesn't work well for smaller projects

### Concurrent Development Models
- It is also called concurrent model
- Communication activity has completed in first iteration and exits in awaiting changes state
- Modelling activity completed its initial communication and then go to underdevelopment state
- Customer specifies the change in requirement, then the modelling activity moves from under development state into awaiting change state
- Advantages:
	- Model is applicable to all types of software development processes
	- Easy for understanding and use
	- Gives immediate feedback from testing
	- Provides an accurate picture of current state of a project
- Disadvantages:
	- Needs better communication between team members
	- Requires to remember the status of different activities

### Software
- Computer program that when executed provides desired features, function and performance
- Two main categories of software are:
	1. Application Software: That fulfils a specific need or performs tasks
	2. System Software: Designed to run a computer's hardware and provides a platform for applications to run on top of
- Characteristics of software: Software characteristics are classified into six major components
	1. Functionality: It refers to degree of performance of software against its intended purpose. Required functions are:
		1. Suitability
		2. Accuracy
		3. Interoperability
		4. Compliance
		5. Security
	2. Reliability: A set of attributes that bears on the capability of software to maintain its level of performance under the given condition for a stated period of time. Required functions are:
		1. Recoverability
		2. Fault Tolerance
		3. Maturity
	3. Efficiency: It refers to the ability of software to use system resources in most effective and efficient manner. The software should make effective use of storage space and executive command as per desired timing requirements. Required functions are:
		1. In Time
		2. In Resource
	4. Usability: It refers to extent to which the software can be used with ease. The amount of effort or time required to learn how to use the software. Required functions are:
		1. Understandability
		2. Learnability
		3. Operability
	5. Maintainability: It refers to ease with which the modifications can be made in a software system to extend its functionality, improve its performance or correct errors. Required functions are:
		1. Testability
		2. Stability
		3. Changability
		4. Operability
	6. Portability: A set of attributes that bears on the ability of software to be transferred from one environment to another, without or minimum changes. Required functions are:
		1. Adaptability
		2. Installability
		3. Replaceability

### Software Engineering
- **Software** is a collection of integrated programs
- **Engineering** is application of scientific and practical knowledge to invent, design, build, maintain and improve frameworks, processes, etc.
- Result of software engineering is an effective and reliable software product
- Need:
	1. Huge Programming
	2. Adaptability
	3. Cost
	4. Dynamic Nature
	5. Quality Management

### As a layered approach
- Software Engineering is fully a layered technology
- All layers are connected and each layer demands the fulfilment of previous layer
- Layered technology is divided into four parts:
	1. **Quality Focus**: It defines the continuous process improvement principles of software. It provides integrity that means providing security to the software so that data can be accessed by only an authorised person, no outsider can access data. It also focuses on maintainability and usability
	2. **Process**: It is the foundation or base layer of software engineering. It is the key that binds all the layers together which enables the development of software before the deadline or on time
	3. **Method**: During the process of software development, the answers to all "how to do" questions are given by method
	4. **Tools**: Software engineering tools provide a self-operating system for processes and methods. Tools are integrated which means information created by one tool can be used by another

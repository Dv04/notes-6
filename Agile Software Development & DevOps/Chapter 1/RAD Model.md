- Rapid Application Development (RAD) Model is a linear sequential software development process model that emphasises a concise development cycle using an element-based construction approach
- If requirements are well understood and described, and project scope is a constraint, the RAD process enables a development team to create a fully functional system within a concise time period
- It is a concept that products can be developed faster and of higher quality through:
	- Gathering Requirements using workshops or focus groups
	- Prototyping and early, reiterative user testing of designs
	- The re-use of software components
	- A rigidly paced schedule that refers design improvements to next product version
	- Less formality in reviews and other team communication
- Various phases:
	1. Business Modelling
	2. Data Modelling
	3. Process Modelling
	4. Application Generation
	5. Testing & Turnover
- When to use RAD Model?
	- Create a project that modularizes in a short span time (2-3 months)
	- When requirements are well-known
	- When technical risk is limited
- Advantages:
	- Model is flexible for change
	- Each phase in RAD brings highest priority functionality to customer
	- Reduced development time
	- Increases re-usability of features
- Disadvantages:
	- Required highly skilled designers
	- All application is not compatible with RAD
	- Not usable for smaller projects
	- On high technical risk, its not suitable
	- Required user involvement

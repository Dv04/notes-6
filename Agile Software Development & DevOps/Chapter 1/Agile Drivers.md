- The agile approach helps organisations manage unpredictability while driving collaboration and transparency across teams, and adoption of a different mind-set to be successful. In an agile environment, development cycles break tasks into small increments
- Nine drivers:
	1. Leadership
	2. Anticipating Change
	3. Flexible and focused
	4. Data Driven
	5. Iterative and Experimental
	6. Clear and Transparent
	7. Collaborative
	8. Empowered
	9. Customer-Centric
- Leadership: Agile leadership sharpens focus, accelerating action and responsiveness of a group of people or organisation
	- Benefits:
		- Improved self-organisation
		- Greater autonomy and self-driven problem solving
		- Fostering of an organisational culture that adheres to agile principles
		- More thoughtful, mutually beneficial support and collaboration between leaders and other team members
		- Improved communications efficiency, time management, and responsiveness that addresses problems head on
		- Fellow team members are more motivated, actively supported and given the chance to get involved
		- Everyone is encouraged to use their voice, share insights
		- More readily adaptive to change and capable of overcoming obstacles together
- Anticipating Changes: Refers to ability to identify and foresee demands, requirements, opportunities, threats and changes. This means identifying changes in technology, shifts in consumer demands and fluctuations in markets that could cause a change to business in future
- Flexible and Focused: Flexibility is at the basis of a truly agile development methodology. Identifying where your felxibility lies, accounting for it in your project plan, and building it into the agile development process will allow you to adapt changes and still have the ability to deliver a successful product
- Data Drive: A data-driven mindset involves building teams of dynamic people to collaborate and adapt to change on a given project to produce the best product possible. It is motivated by increasing inflow of user feedback
- Iterative and Experimental: An iteration is a repeated interval in which work items are fully developed and tested. Projects are made up of as many iterations as needed to complete the necessary work. Iterative methodology allows software developers to adjust, refine and review software development processes constantly to improve their performance incrementally
- Clear and Transparent: It builds upon the fundamental values of agile methodologies. Within the scrum, framework, which is a widely adopted agile methodology, transparency stands tall as one of the three pillars of an empirical process, alongside inspection and adaptation. It allows to:
	- Assess teams progress towards sprint goals
	- Identify excessive work in progress
	- Recognise obstacles in completing tasks
	- Build trust and communication
- Collaborative:
	- Understand your role
	- Communicate frequently and clearly
	- Embrace feedback and leaning
	- Respect diversity and inclusion
	- Support and trust each other
- Empowered: Agile leadership is based on belief that teams and individuals are capable of making good decisions when given trust and autonomy. Agile leaders empower their teams by:
	- Providing a clear vision of goals
	- Encouraging collaboration
	- Removing Obstacles
- Customer Centric: It is a business practice that involves prioritising customers and creating positive experiences for them. Its a mindset that helps organisations make decisions based on how they affect customers and end-users. It can lead to greater profits, increased employee management and more satisfied customers. Some steps are:
	- Understand customer needs and expectations
	- Align business strategies with customer needs
	- Empower employees to prioritise customer satisfaction
	- Continuously monitor and improve the customer experience
- Some key pillars for customer-centricity include: Price, Range and Service, Promotions, Affinity, Rewards, Ease, Communications

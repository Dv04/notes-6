- It requires that before carrying out the development of actual software, a working prototype of system should be built
- A prototype usually turns out to be a very crude version of actual system, possible exhibiting limited functional capabilities, low reliability, and inefficient performance as compared to actual software
- Steps of prototype model:
	1. Requirement Gathering and Analyst
	2. Quick Decision
	3. Build a Prototype
	4. Assessment or User Evaluation
	5. Prototype Refinement
	6. Engineer Product
- Advantage:
	- Reduce the risk of incorrect user requirement
	- Good where requirement is changing/uncommitted
	- Regular visible process aids management
	- Support early product marketing
	- Reduce Maintenance Cost
	- Errors can be detected much earlier as the system is made side by side
- Disadvantages:
	- Difficult to know how long the project will last
	- Prototyping tools are expensive
	- Special tools & techniques are required to build a prototype
	- It is a time-consuming process

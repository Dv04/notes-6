- **Models**: Crystal Agile Software Development Methodology places a strong emphasis on fostering effective communication and collaboration among team members, as well as taking into account the human elements that are crucial for a successful development process. This methodology is particularly beneficial for projects with a high degree of uncertainty, where requirements tend to change frequently
- **Atern**: This methodology is tailored for projects with moderate to high uncertainty where requirements are prone to change frequently. Governance practices set it apart and make it an effective approach for teams and projects
- **Feature-driven development**: This approach is implemented by utilising a series of techniques, like creating feature lists, conducting model evaluations, and implementing a design-by-feature method, to meet its goal. It is particularly effective in ensuring the end product is delivered on time and that it aligns with requirements of the customer
- **Scrum**: This methodology serves as a framework for tackling complex projects and ensuring their successful completion. It is led by a Scrum Master, who oversees the process and a Product Owner, who establishes the priorities
- **Extreme Programming (XP)**: It uses specific practices like pair programming, continuous integration, and test-driven development to achieve these goals. Extreme Programming is ideal for projects that have high levels of uncertainty and require frequent changes, as it allows for quick adaptation to new requirements and feedback
- **Lean Development**: It is rooted in the principles of lean manufacturing and aims to streamline the process by identifying and removing unnecessary steps and activities. This is achieved through practices such as continuous improvement, visual management and value stream mapping, which helps in identifying areas of improvement and implementing changes accordingly
- **Unified Process**: It is a methodology that can be tailored to the specific needs of any given project. It combines elements of both waterfall and agile methodologies, allowing for an iterative and incremental approach to development. This means that the Unified Process is characterised by a series of iterations, each of which results in a working product increment, allowing for continuous improvement and the delivery of value to the customer

### Software Processes
- A software process is the set of activities and associated outcome that produce a software product
- A software process model is an abstraction of the actual process, which is being described. It can also be defined as a simplified representation of a software process. Each model represents a process from a specific perspective
- A generic process framework encompasses five activities which are given below one by one:
	1. **Communication**: Heavy communication with customers and other stakeholders, as well as requirement gathering is done
	2. **Planning**: We discuss the technical related tasks, work schedule, risks, required resources, etc.
	3. **Modelling**: It is about building representation of things in real world. A product's model is created in order to better understand the requirements
	4. **Construction**: Construction is the application of set of procedures that are needed to assemble the product. Code is generated and testes in order to make better product
	5. **Deployment**: A complete or non-complete product or software is represented to customers to evaluate and give feedback. On basis of their feedback, we modify the product for supply of better product

### Umbrella Activities
- Umbrella activities are that take place during a software development process for improved project management and tracking:
	1. **Software Project Tracking and Control**: This is an activity in which the team can assess progress and take corrective action to maintain the schedule
	2. **Risk Management**: The risks that may affect project outcomes or quality can be analysed. Analyse potential risks that may have an impact on the software product's quality and outcome
	3. **Software Quality Assurance**: Activities required to maintain software quality. Perform actions to ensure product's quality
	4. **Formal Technical Reviews**: Required to assess engineering work products to uncover and remote errors before they propagate to next activity. At each level of process, errors are evaluated and fixed
	5. **Software Configuration Management**: Managing of configuration process when any change in software occurs
	6. **Work Product Preparation and Production**: Activities to create models, documents, logs, forms and lists are carried out
	7. **Reusability Management**: It defines criteria for work product reuse. Reusable work items should be backed up and reusable software components should be achieved
	8. **Measurement**: Process can be defined and collected. Also, project and product measures are used to assist the software team in delivering the required software

### Basic Software Process Models
- **A Workflow Model**: It is sequential series of tasks and decisions that make up a business process
- **The Waterfall Model**: It is a sequential design process in which progress is seen as flowing steadily downwards. Phases in waterfall model:
	1. Requirements Specification
	2. Software Design
	3. Implementation
	4. Testing
- **Dataflow Model**: It is diagrammatic representation of flow and exchange of information within a system
- **Evolutionary Development Model**: Following activities are considered in this method:
	1. Specification
	2. Development
	3. Validation
- **Role/Action Model**: Roles of people involved in software process and the activities

### Need for Process Model
- Software Development team must decide the process model that is to be used for software product development and then the entire team must adhere to it. This is necessary because the software product development can then be done systematically. Process model will bring the definiteness and discipline in overall development process
- Every process model consists of definite entry and exit criteria for each phase. Hence the transition of the product through various phases is definite
- If the process model is not followed for software development then any team member can perform any software development activity, this will ultimately cause a chaos and software project will definitely fail without using process model, it is difficult to monitor the progress of software product

### Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
- It represents the process of developing software
- It includes the following steps:
	1. **Planning and Requirement Analysis**: It is the most important and necessary stage in SDLC. Planning for quality assurance requirements and identifications of risks associated with projects is also done at this stage
	2. **Defining Requirements**: Once the requirement analysis is done, the next stage is to certainly represent and document the software requirements and get them accepted from project stakeholders. This is accomplished through-Software Requirement Specification document which contains all product requirements to be constructed and developed during the project life cycle
	3. **Designing the Software**: Next phase is to bring down all the knowledge of requirements, analysis, and design of software project
	4. **Developing the Project**: The actual development begins, and the programming is built
	5. **Testing**: After code is generated, it is tested against the requirements to make sure that the products are solving the needs addressed and gathered during the requirements stage. During this stage, unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing is done
	6. **Deployment**: Once software is certified, and no bugs or errors are stated, then it is deployed
	7. **Maintenance**: When client starts using the developed systems, then the real issues come up and requirements to be solved from time to time/ This procedure where the care is taken for the developed product is known as maintenance

### Software Development Models
- **Waterfall Model**:
	- First SDLC Model to be widely used in Software Engineering
	- The whole process of software development is divided into separate phases
	- Typically, the outcome of one phase acts as the input for the next phase sequentially
	- The sequential phases in Waterfall Model are:
		1. Requirement Gathering and Analysis
		2. System Design
		3. Implementation
		4. Integration and Testing
		5. Deployment of System
		6. Maintenance
- **Iterative Model**:
	- In this model, we start with some of the software specifications and develop the first version of the software
	- After the first version, if there is a need to change the software, then a new version of software is created with a new iteration
	- Every release of Iterative Model finishes in an exact and fixed period that is called iteration
	- It allows accessing earlier phases, in which variations made respectively
	- Uses:
		1. When requirements are defined clearly and easy to understand
		2. When software application is large
		3. When there is a requirement of changes in future
	- Advantages:
		1. Testing and debugging during smaller iteration is easy
		2. Parallel development can be planned
		3. Easily acceptable to ever-changing needs of project
		4. Risks are identified and resolved during iteration
		5. Limited time spent on documentation and extra time on designing
	- Disadvantages:
		1. Not suitable for smaller projects
		2. More resources may be required
		3. Design can be changed again and again because of imperfect requirements
		4. Requirements changes can cause over budget
		5. Project completion date not confirmed because of changing requirements
- **Incremental Model**:
	- Requirements are divided into multiple standalone modules of software development cycle
	- Each module goes through requirements, design, implementation and testing phases
	- Every subsequent release of module adds function to previous release
	- The process continues until complete system is achieved
	- Phases:
		1. Requirement Analysis
		2. Design & Development
		3. Testing
		4. Implementation
	- Advantages:
		- Errors are easy to be recognised
		- Easier to test and debug
		- More flexible
	- Disadvantages:
		- Need for good planning
		- Total Cost is high
		- Well defined module interfaces are needed

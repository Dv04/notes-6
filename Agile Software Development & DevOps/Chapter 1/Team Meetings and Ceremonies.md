### What are Agile Ceremonies ?
 - Within agile development, a ceremony refers to a structured, regular gathering desired to uphold effective work practices and ensure task completion. These gatherings involve agile project team members, serving to synchronise everyone on project advancement and guarantee the unified pursuit of the common objective
 - Agile ceremonies have their origins in the software development principle of agile iteration, which is the practice of dividing a project into small, manageable pieces and then completing each piece one at a time
 - Agile ceremonies usually last a short duration and typically involve all members of agile team
 - During an agile ceremony, team members typically use a whiteboard to brainstorm ideas and track progress
 - Current trends in agile ceremonies include using digital tools to facilitate remote team meetings as well as using information radiators to provide a visual representation of work
 - *Why Agile Ceremonies are often referred to as scrums ?* Agile ceremonies are often referred to as scrums or scrum ceremonies because they are attributed to the scrum framework of development which is one of the most popular types of agile software development methodologies, where a lot of teamwork and coordination is involved

### Four Agile Ceremonies
1. **Sprint Planning**
	- It is a meeting that occurs at beginning of every sprint where the team determines what tasks they will complete during the sprint
	- The purpose of a sprint planning meeting is to ensure that the team has a shared understanding of the tasks that need to be completed during the sprint
	- It is essential for ensuring that the team is on the same page and has a clear plan for the sprint
2. **Daily Standup**
	- It is a meeting that occurs every day where each development team member updates the rest of the team on what they did yesterday, what they plan to do today, and any blockers or issues they are facing
	- The purpose of standup ceremonies is that the team is always aligned and aware of the project's status
	- The information from each team member is shared with rest of the team so that everyone is always up-to-date
	- It fosters fast decision making, eliminates the need for elaborate meetings
3. **Sprint Review**
	- It is a meeting that occurs at the end of every sprint where the team demonstrates to the product owner what they completed during the sprint
	- Two important things happen during sprint reviews:
		1. Scrum team members present their work to the product owner
		2. Product Owner, Other stakeholders and the entire scrum team members discuss the overall progress towards the main goal
4. **Sprint Retrospective**:
	- It is a meeting that also takes place at the end of every sprint, in which the team reflects on how the sprint went and identifies ways to improve their process
	- It is more life the agile ceremonies that concludes a sprint, call it the final scrum ceremony
	- Purpose of sprint retrospectives is to get feedback from team members about what went well during the sprint and what didn't go so well, so that the team can identify areas for improvement and make changes accordingly
	- The goal is to help and encourage the team to identify the most valuable changes that need to be implemented in order to improve effectiveness

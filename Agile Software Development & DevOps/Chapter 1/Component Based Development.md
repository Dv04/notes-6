- The component-based assembly model uses object-oriented technologies
- This model uses various characteristics of spiral model. This model is evolutionary by nature. Hence, software development can be done using iterative approach
- In CBD model, multiple classes can be used. These classes are basically the pre-packaged components. The model works in following manner:
	1. Identify all the required candidate components, i.e., classes with help of application data and algorithms
	2. If these candidate components are used in previous software projects, then they must be present in library
	3. Such pre-existing components can be excited from the library and used for further development
	4. But if the required component is not present in the library then build or create the component as per requirement
	5. Place this newly created component in the library. This makes one iteration of the system
	6. Repeat steps 1 to 5 for creating n iteration, where n denotes the number of iterations required to develop the complete application
- Characteristics:
	- Uses object-oriented technology
	- Components and classes encapsulate both data and algorithms
	- Components are developed to be reusable
	- Paradigm similar to spiral model, but engineering activity involves components
	- The system produced by assembling the correct components

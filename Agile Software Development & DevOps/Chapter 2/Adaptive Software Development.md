- Method to build complex software and system
- Focuses on human collaboration and self-organisation
- Adaptive Software Development practices provide ability to accommodate change and are adaptable in turbulent environments with products evolving with little planning and learning

### Phases of ASD Life Cycle
- It is cyclical like Evolutionary Model, with phase names reflecting the unpredictability in complex systems
- Phases in adaptive development life cycle are:
	- Speculate
	- Collaborate
	- Learn
- These 3 phases reflect dynamic nature of Adaptive Software Development
	- The ASD Lifecycle focuses on result, not tasks and the results are identified as application features

### Characteristics of ASD
- It has 6 basic characteristics:
	1. Mission Driven
	2. Feature Based
	3. Iterative
	4. Time boxed
	5. Risk Driven
	6. Change Tolerant

### Advantages
- Useful for rapid and complex software product development
- Easy software incremental adjustment
- Focus on end-users, meeting requirements, and fulfilling demands
- Allows on-time delivery with maximum customer satisfaction
- Provides high transparency between developers and clients
- Reduced vulnerabilities and bugs as undergoes multiple testing

### Disadvantages
- Working in an uncertain environment is challenging
- Proceeding only with mission needs broad exploration and constant focus
- Requires high user/client involvement
- Requires testing into each iteration which increases the cost
- Frequent changes undergo with less documentation
- Requires strict time commitment between different teams involved in project

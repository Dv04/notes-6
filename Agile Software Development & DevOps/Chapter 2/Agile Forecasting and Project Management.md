- In broad sense of Agile, Estimation refers to expert opinions about when a piece of work can be completed based on its complexity

### Various Estimation Technique
- T-Shirt Size Estimation: Work items are each estimated using standard t-shirt sizing. The sizing gives an overview of the complexity or required effort depending on team's preference
- Relative Sizing: Grouping or categorising work items with similar or equivalent difficulty
- Planning Poker: Team members use numbered cards to assign story points to user stories and determine work items' complexity
- Bucket System Estimation: This approach discusses the work items which are divided into buckets based on their complexity
- Three-point method: It is a probabilistic approach where each work item is assigned three different values to reflect optimistic, pessimistic and most likely outcomes
- Story Point Estimation: Used to accurately forecast and plan agile projects, giving us a clear picture of the effort and complexity involved in each user story
- Wideband Delphi: To emphasise a certain point or idea, it is important to investigate the truth of a theory
- Comparative Estimation: Engaging in comparative estimation allows us to tap into the collective wisdom of our team, inspiring confidence and fostering a sense of shared ownership

### Benefits of Agile Estimation
- Estimates can help break down, plan and prioritise work and ultimately improve the efficiency of managing agile projects
- Proper work sizing can be beneficial to project management in various ways
- Improved Coordination
- Decision-making enhancements
- Better risk management

### Pitfalls of Estimating Work
- Estimates do not account for uncertainties
- Estimates cannot be final
- Misuse of estimations

### Who is involved in Agile Estimation Process ?
- Every team member should be involved in the work estimation process
- Development team members
- Team leaders
- Product Owners
- Scrum Masters

### Agile Forecasting
- Forecasting the completion of an agile project becomes really simple
- There are two main inputs to the forecast:
	- The first input is the sum of story point estimates for all features
	- The second input is the forecasted velocity of the team
- The forecasted velocity is very straightforward for teams that are up and running

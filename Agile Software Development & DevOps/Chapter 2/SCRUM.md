- It is a type of Agile Framework
- It is a framework within which people can address complex adaptive problem while productivity and creativity of delivering product is at highest possible values
- It uses Iterative Process
- Silent features of Scrum are:
	- It is light-weighted framework
	- It emphasises self-organisation
	- It is simple to understand
	- It helps the team to work together

### Scrum Roles
- **Product Owner**: Person with product vision
- **Scrum Master**: Scrum expert who helps the team build the product according to the scrum framework
- **Development Team**: Team members who execute the work

- **Sprint**:
	- A Sprint is a time box of one moth or less
	- A new Sprint starts immediately after the completion of the previous sprint
- **Release**: When the product is completed, it goes to Release Stage
- **Sprint Review**: If product still has some non-achievable features, it will be checked in this stage and passed to the Sprint Retrospective Stage
- **Sprint Retrospective**: In this stage quality or status of product is checked
- **Product Backlog**: According to the prioritise features the product is organised
- **Sprint Backlog**: It is divided into two parts:
	- Product Assigned Features to Sprint
	- Sprint Planning Meeting

### Advantages of using Scrum
- It is fast moving and money efficient
- It works by dividing large product into small sub-products. It's like a divide and conquer strategy
- In Scrum, customer satisfaction is very important
- It is adaptive in nature because it has short sprint
- It relies on constant feedback therefore the quality of product increases in less amount of time

### Disadvantages of using Scrum
- It does not allow changes into their sprint
- It is not fully described model. To adopt it, we need to fill in the framework with our own details, like Extreme Programming (XP), Kanban, etc.
- Difficult for Scrum to plan, structure and organise a project that lacks a clear definition
- Daily Scrum meetings and frequent reviews require substantial resources

### Scrum Process
- Scrum process encourages practitioners to work with what they have and continually evaluate what is or is not working
- Good communication is essential and is carried out through meetings, called events
- Scrum events include the following:
	- **Daily Scrum**:
		- It is a short, stand-up daily meeting that takes place in the same place and time each day
		- The team reviews work accomplished the previous day and plans that will be done in next 24 hours
		- Time when team members discuss problems that might prevent project completion
	- **Sprint**:
		- A sprint is the time frame in which work must be completed -- often 30 days
		- New Sprints start right after the end of previous one
	- **Sprint Planning Meeting**:
		- Everyone participates in setting goals
	- **Sprint Review**: Time to show off the increment
	- **Sprint Retrospective**: A meeting held after a Sprint ends. During this meeting, everyone reflects on the process
	- A team-building exercise may also be offered. An important goal of this event is continuous improvement

### Scrum Artifacts
- An artifact is something of historical interest that warrants being re-examined. In Scrum product development, artifacts are used to see what has been done and what is still in the queue
- Scrum artifacts include:
	- **Product Backlog**:
		- Refers to what remains to be done
		- The development team works with business owner to prioritise work that has been backlogged
		- Product backlog may be fine-tuned during a process called backlog refinement
	- **Sprint Backlog**:
		- List of tasks that must be completed before selected product backlog items can be delivered
		- These are divided into time-based user stories
	- **Product Increment**:
		- Refers to what has been accomplished during a Sprint -- all the product backlog items -- as well as what's been created during all previous sprints
		- Product increment reflects how much progress has been made
	- **Burn Down**:
		- A burndown chart is a visual representation of amount of work that still needs to be completed
		- A burndown chart has a Y axis that shows work and an X axis that shows time
		- Ideally, the chart illustrates a downward trend, as the amount of work still left to do over time burns down to zero

### Benefits of Scrum Methodology
- **Quality Products**:
	- Sprint retrospective part of Scrum process builds in feedback and continuous improvement
- **Teamwork**:
	- Scrum creates cohesive software development teams that communicate effectively, meet deadlines and solve problems together
	- Members trust and respect one another and understand their time is valuable
- **Flexibility**:
	- Teams have to adapt their tools and processes to new circumstances as they happen
	- Product definitions may change as development progresses and effective teams deliver those changes within a few iterations
- **Reduced Risk**:
	- Scrum focuses on a predictable, sustainable delivery pace and consistent feedback that gives teams a chance to mitigate risk early and often
	- Short sprints let teams fail fast if an idea doesn't work, keeping the risk of failure manageable
- **Decreased time to market**:
	- Scrum aims to release products and their features in predictable increments using well-defined sprints
	- Entire product does not need to be done for features to be released
- **High Return on Investment (ROI)**:
	- Scrum's combined benefits lead to a higher ROI
	- Constant feedback leads to less costly mistakes late in process and a better product with fewer defects

### Scrum Pillars
- The three pillars of Scrum are:
	- Adaptation
	- Inspection
	- Transparency
- Three pillars of Scrum are sometimes known as three pillars of empiricism

### Scrum Values
- Five core values that support the pillars:
	- Commitment
	- Courage
	- Focus
	- Openness
	- Respect

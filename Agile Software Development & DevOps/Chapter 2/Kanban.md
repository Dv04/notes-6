- An agile management method that uses visual project management to help teams efficiently manage and track their projects
- Based on philosophy of continuous improvement, where work items are pulled from a product backlog and moved into a steady flow of work
- Kanban boards are a form of visual project management that use a framework to help visualise tasks
- Kanban boards often have a backlog for customers and teammates to put ideas for projects
- A lean project management method that breaks milestones into small tasks
- It differs from waterfall process in that it doesn't force team members to complete entire stages before moving forward with deliverables

### Some Rules of Kanban Include
- Never pass defective products
- Take only whats needed
- Produce the exact quantity required
- Level the production
- Fine-tune the production or process optimisation
- Stabilise and rationalise the process

- Main aim of Kanban is to reduce WIP (Work-In-Progress) or inventory, between processes by ensuring the upstream process creates parts as long as its downstream process needs it
- Goal of the kanban execution is to ensure work items move to the next steps quickly to realise business value faster
- It is an approach to evolutionary and incremental systems and process change for organisations
- It is a popular framework which is used to implement agile software development. It takes real time communication of capacity and complete transparency of work
- Work items are represented in a Kanban board visually, allowing team members to see the state of every piece of work at any time

### Elements
- Visual Signals
- Columns
- Work-In-Progress (WIP) Limits
- Commitment Point
- Delivery Point

### Kanban is best suited in below scenarios
- Dynamic/frequent changing requirements which need to be delivered faster
- In case of changing priorities, the prioritised work can be pulled by team as soon as WIP limit drops
- Frequent releases are there
- Incoming work is continuous
- Task priority is decided dynamically based upon task nature and type

### Kanban might not be right fit for project where
- Tasks could remain in wait state for long
- Mainly research-oriented takes are there
- For enhancements where requirements are evolving/unclear
- No prior scope is not defined and tasks keep on evolving
- Too much dependency is there between tasks
- If all items across work stages need to be collated, then deployed

### Principles of Kanban
- Start with the existing process
- Agree to continue evolutionary and incremental changes
- Admire current roles, processes, responsibilities & titles
- Leadership at all levels

### Kanban Practices
- Limit WIP
- Visualise
- Manage Flow
- Improve Collaboratively, Evolve Experimentally
- Implement Feedback Loops
- Make Policies Explicit

### Kanban Approach
- Visualise
- Quantify
	1. Startup
	2. Adjust
	3. Measure
- Optimise
	1. Identify and Improve
	2. Establish Standards
	3. Envision for continuous improvement

### Benefits of using Kanban Framework
- Limiting WIP and setting policies will result in a better focus on quality and, as a result, increased customer satisfaction
- Use transparency to drive process improvement
- Minimised Waste
- Less process overhead
- Better task flow
- Composition of team can also be changed
- Helps achieve improved productivity of teams
- Prioritisation helps in streamlining processes and workflow
- Enhanced quality of work
- Identification and elimination of bottlenecks
- Reduced queue time
- Reduction of wasted effort

### Disadvantages of Kanban
- Over simplification
- Limited Utility
- Difficulty Tracking progress
- Lack of time representation
- Overwhelming Work
- Inefficient visualisation
- Limited feedback loops
- Resistance to change
- Misuse of board
- Over-Complications
- Outdated board
- Limited WIP limits

### Kanban vs Scrum

| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Planning, release and process improvement can have separate cadences          | Iteration is time boxed                                                  |
| For planning and process improvement, the lead time is used as default metric | For planning and process improvement, velocity is used as default metric |
| Cross-functional teams are optional                                           | Cross-functional teams prescribed                                        |
| Project Tracking: CFD can be used to understand workflow progress             | Project Tracking: Burndown chart is prescribed                           |
| WIP limited directly                                                          | WIP limited indirectly                                                   |
| Can add new items whenever the WIP limit falls                                | Cannot add items to ongoing iteration                                    |

### How FDD differs from SCRUM ?
- FDD:
	- FDD allows teams to update the project regularly and identify errors quickly
	- Clients can be provided with information and substantial results at any time
	- FDD values documentation more than other methods, which also creates differences in the roles of meetings
	- Actual user is viewed as end user
- SCRUM:
	- Teams typically meet on a daily basis
	- Teams rely on documentation to communicate important information and thus don't usually meet as frequently
	- Product Owner is the end user

### FDD Lifecycle
- Build overall model
- Build feature list
- Plan by feature
- Design by feature
- Build by feature

### Stages of FDD
1. Gather data
2. Develop an overall model
3. Build a feature list
4. Plan by feature
5. Design by feature
6. Build by feature

### Characteristics of FDD
- Short iterative
- Customer focused
- Structured and Feature focused
- Frequent Releases

### Advantages of FDD
- Reporting at all levels leads to easier progress tracking
- It provides continuous success for larger size of teams and projects
- Reduction in risks is observed as whole model and design is built in smaller segments
- It provides greater accuracy in cost estimation of project due to feature segmentation

### Disadvantages of FDD
- Agile practice is not good for smaller projects
- High dependency on lead programmers, designers and mentors
- Lack of documentation which can create an issue afterwards

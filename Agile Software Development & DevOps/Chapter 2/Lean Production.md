- Lean means creating more value for customers with fewer resources
- It focuses on the process
- Adopted from Toyota
- Increases customer value and reduces waste

### Lean Software Development
- It is an agile framework that is used to streamline and optimise the software development process
- It may also be referred to as Minimum Viable Product strategy as these ways of thinking are very much alike since both intend to speed up development by focusing on new deliverables

### Advantages of LSD
- It removes unnecessary process stages when designing software so that it acts as a time saver as simplifies the development process
- With focus on MVP, LSD prioritises essential functions so this removes risk of spending time on valueless builds
- It increases involvement power of team as more and more members participate due to which the overall workflow becomes optimised and losses get reduced
- It simplifies the development process and saves time
- Increases involvement of team members, optimising workflow and reducing losses
- It encourages collaboration and communication among team members and stakeholders
- Fosters innovation through experimentation and creativity
- Reduces waste by minimising unnecessary features
- Increases customer satisfaction through customer involvement and feedback
- Improves flexibility by allowing for adaptability to changing requirements and circumstances

### Key Principles of Lean Software Development
- There are 7 established lean principles that come with a set of tactics, practices and processes that builds more efficient software products:
	1. Eliminating the waste
	2. Fast Delivery
	3. Amplify Learning
	4. Builds Quality
	5. Respect Teamwork
	6. Delay the commitment
	7. Optimising the whole system
- Eliminating Waste: To identify and eliminate wastes, e.g., unnecessary code, delay in processes, inefficient communication, etc.
- Fast Delivery: MVP strategy which results in building products quickly that included a little functionality and launch the product to market and see the reaction. This approach allows them to enhance the product on basis of customer feedback
- Amplify Learning: It is improved through ample code reviewing, meeting that is cross-team applicable. It is also ensured that particular knowledge isn't accumulated by one engineer who's writing particular piece of code so paired programming is used
- Builds Quality: 
	- LSD is all about preventing waste, keeping an eye on not sacrificing quality
	- Developers often apply test-driven programming to examine code before its written
	- The quality can also be gained to get constant feedback from team members and project managers
- Respect Teamwork:
	- LSD focuses on empowering team members, rather than controlling them
	- Setting up a collaborative atmosphere, keep perfect balance when there are short deadlines and immense workload
- Delay the commitment:
	- In traditional project management it often happens when you make your application and it turns out to be completely unfit for market
	- LSD method recognises this threat and makes room for improvement by postponing irreversible decision until all experiment is done
	- This methodology always constructs software as flexible, so the new knowledge is available and engineers can make improvements
- Optimising the whole system: Lean's principle allows managers to break an issue into small constituent parts to optimise the team's workflow, create unity among members, and inspire a sense of shared responsibility which results in enhancing the team performance

### Key Features of LSD
- Focus on continuous improvement and waste elimination
- Iterative and Collaborative Approach
- Development of Minimum Viable Product
- Customer Involvement and Feedback
- Flexible and Adaptive Approach
- Prioritisation of essential functions and minimisation of waste

### Weakness in LSD
- Scalability is strongly dependent on team involved
- Hard to keep pace so it is not easy for developers to work with team members as conflict may occur between them
- Leads to a difficult decision-making process as it is mandatory for customers to clearly set their requirements for development not to be interrupted
- Lack of documentation
- Inflexibility for structured projects or strict deadlines
- Lack of predictability
- Dependence on customer involvement

- LSD is one of the proactive approaches that drives your body through productivity and cleanliness
- It closely connects to Agile methodology, knowledge-sharing experience, fast product delivery
- All processes and stages of development are accurately built to deliver the end product at minimum cost in a timely manner

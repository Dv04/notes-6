- It is a metric that measures how much work an agile team can deliver in a given timeframe. It's also known as throughput
	- The rate at which our team can deliver is a key agile metric, known as velocity
	- It is a useful tool for teams to use internally, not necessarily to use for external determinations
	- Agile Velocity Formula
		- To calculate velocity of a sprint, we need to know:
			- How many user stories the team has to complete
			- The number of points that a user story is worth
		- Then look at number of stories completed and add up the points
- Benefits of velocity in agile:
	- Help project managers determine how much work they can complete in a sprint
	- Accurate indicator of a unique team's progress
	- Determine the number of sprints that will be needed for the project and how much time each sprint needs
- Common pitfalls of velocity in Agile:
	- Cannot be considered a surefire way to budget or forecast with a project
	- Comparison between different teams and their performance
	- Requires very careful and consistent estimations throughout

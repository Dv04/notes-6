### Grippers:
- A mechanical or robotic device designed to grasp, hold, manipulate, or transport objects.
- Serves as hand or end effector of a robotic arm or an automation system, allowing robot to interact with the physical world
- Types of grippers:
	1. **Parallel Jaw Grippers**: Most prevalent and Versatile. Comprise of two opposing jaws capable of moving parallel to each other and can grasp objects of diverse shapes and sizes
		- Known for speed and reliability
		- Applications: Packaging, Manufacturing and Assembly Lines
		- There are two ways a gripper can hold an object: **Physical Force** or **Friction**
		- Friction method of holding a part is less complex and less expensive:$$\mu n f = w$$
	2. **Vacuum or Suction Grippers**: Particularly effective at handling **flat and smooth-surface items** like glass, plastic, etc.
		- Applications: Food Industry, Printing, Production of Electronics
		- Lifting capacity can be determined by:$$f=pA$$
	3. **Finger Grippers**: Perfect Solution for manipulating objects with irregular shapes or intricate geometries
		- Commonly used for tasks like bin picking
		- Their adaptability and flexibility make them ideal for a variety of automation tasks that require a **High Degree of Dexterity**
		- Can be equipped with tactile sensors or force feedback systems, allowing them to adjust their grip based on object's properties
	4. **Hydraulic Grippers**: Employ hydraulic fluid to precisely operate their jaws, excelling in tasks that entail handling sizeable and weighty objects demanding substantial gripping force
		- Applications: Construction, Agriculture, Material Handling
		- Operate effectively in high loads and in harsh environmental conditions
		- Built to withstand toughest conditions and provide reliable performance for heavy-duty applications
	5. **Pneumatic Grippers**: Use compressed air to control movement of their jaws
		- Known for speed and ability to provide a strong grip
		- Applications: Automotive Manufacturing, Electronics Assembly lines
		- Come in various configurations: Two-finger, Three-finger, Angular Grippers, etc.
		- Jaw movements are rapid, robust and durable
	6. **Electromagnetic Grippers**: Leverage magnetic fields to hold and manipulate magnetic objects
		- Highly effective when a strong and stable grip on a metal object is required
		- An adhesive substance can be used to handle fabrics and other lightweight materials. It's limitation is that its effectiveness is list with repeated use
- There exist other type of gripping device, like, hooks, scoops, ladles, etc.

### Selection of Grippers:
- Speed:
	- If fast but not so accurate motion is desired then pneumatic should be preferred, else, go for electric. For Heavy Objects, go for Hydraulic
- Quality of surface area
	- Mechanical gripper may damage surface area
- Gripper should tolerate some dimension change and size variation
